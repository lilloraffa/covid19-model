# Covid 19 Epidemic Diffusion Model

This is an attempt to build an evolutionary model for the diffusion of the Covid-19 virus. It is still in a very 
preliminary status, I've put little attention for now at core readability / reusability, which I intend to do in the 
next days. I'll update this repo as much as I can.

You find the python code of the model in `coronavirus_mod_ita` folder. `model.py` contains the theoretical model whose 
description is contained in `model.md`; `optimizer.py` contains the code for the numerical calibration procedure. 
Finally, the `notebooks` folder contains few notebooks showing how I used the python library. I'll make more usable in 
next days, and I'll write here a backlog of what I do / find.

Some discussion and new evidence on the model can be found here: [https://raffaelelillo.blog](https://raffaelelillo.blog)

I hope this can be of some interest, if you would like to contribute or to give me your feedback, please contact me at
any time, I'll be very happy to discuss.

Stay home, be safe and ad majora!
